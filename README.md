# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing-

The first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include, for example, the passenger safety cell with crumple zone, the airbag and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium carmakers. Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.

To ensure the safety and reliability of each and every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. But, optimizing the speed of their testing system for so many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Daimler’s production lines.

If a car takes more time on testing then it will affect the price of the car because Daimler’s is spending their electricity, man-power, warehouse cost and other material. So more the test time more will be the cost of the car.

The more time car spend during testing, the more CO2 will produce. If we compare CO2 emission of the whole world w.r.t Daimler’s testing machine then Daimler’s contribution of CO2 is less. If whole testing industries will adapt this then it will somehow decrease the CO2 emission on large scale.
The objective of the Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing competition is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the time a car will spend on the test bench based on the vehicle configuration. The vehicle configuration is defined as the set of customization options and features selected for the particular vehicle. The motivation behind the problem is that an accurate model will be able to reduce the total time spent testing vehicles by allowing cars with similar testing configurations to be run successively.
